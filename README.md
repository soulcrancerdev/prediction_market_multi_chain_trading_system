## Popular Copy Trading Strategies

Based on trending discussions on X in 2025-2026, here are key strategies for successful Polymarket copy trading. These emphasize selecting consistent traders and avoiding common pitfalls (e.g., blind copying leading to losses in 90% of cases).

1. **Build a Portfolio of Traders**
   - Diversify across 3-5 traders with expertise in specific markets (e.g., sports, politics, crypto).
   - Analyze wallet history: P&L curve, win rate, risk-reward, max drawdown.
   - Use "Copy Score" (e.g., R² * win rate * profit factor) to rank traders.
   - Avoid loud whales; target small quants with steady profits.

2. **Proportional Sizing and Risk Limits**
   - Mirror trades proportionally (e.g., if whale risks 5% of $1M, you risk 5% of your portfolio).
   - Cap risk at 7% per trade, max 3 open positions.
   - Start small (0.1% allocation) for testing.

3. **Custom Bot Parameters**
   - Skip certain markets or categories.
   - Set size multipliers based on trade size/category (e.g., chase spreads for high-volume trades).
   - Use retries with FAK/GTD orders; adjust for live vs. non-live markets.
   - Copy % (e.g., 50-100% of trader's size).

4. **Target Specific Trader Types**
   - **AI Sentiment Bots**: Copy bots that profit from news reactions (5-20 min window).
   - **Mean Reversion Bots**: Follow bots snapping up panic dumps.
   - **Undervaluation Traders**: Mirror those betting on low-attention, mispriced markets (e.g., lower leagues).
   - **Low/High Price Specialists**: Copy low-entry (0.1¢) high-frequency or high-entry (99¢) near-resolution plays.

5. **Wallet Baskets Approach**
   - Group 5-10 similar wallets; enter only when 80%+ align on the same outcome within a tight price range.

6. **Pre-Copy Checklist**
   - Trade manually first (10-20 trades) to understand risk.
   - Observe 5-10 trades before automating.
   - Match trader expertise to your interests (e.g., skip NHL if unfamiliar).
   - Ensure liquid markets (min $1M volume) to avoid moving prices.

7. **Advanced Tips**
   - Combine with domain specialization (10-20% allocation).
   - Monitor for adverse selection: Ensure your slippage + fees < trader's edge per share.
   - Learn from failures: Avoid being exit liquidity or news traps.
